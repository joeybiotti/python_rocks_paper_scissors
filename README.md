# Python Rocks Paper Scissors

Another python console app. To run the app, enter the following commands: 

`mkdir rocks_paper_scissors && cd rocks_paper_scissors`

`git pull origin master`

`python app.py`


Then the user will be prompted to enter the names of the first player and the second player. Then each user will be prompted to enter the choice of either rocks, paper or scissors. Whoever wins, wins. You know the rules. 

I found this exercise <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/26/08-rock-paper-scissors.html">here</a>. This was a fun one, and I struggled a bit.
